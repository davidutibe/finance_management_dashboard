## Introduction
Home Store (hypthetical), is a growing grocery delivery service across Nigeria, faced with tightening gross margins and a slowdown in repeat purchases. Leadership suspected that blanket discounting strategies were undercutting profitability and sought a more data-driven approach to pricing, bundling, and promotions.

Using SQL, I analyzed their sales and customer data to identify patterns in margin contribution, customer behavior, and bundle effectivenessâ€”leading to clear, actionable recommendations.

## Project Description
The project involves the analysis of the Home Store Sales and Customer behaviour Data. The tasks to be completed include:
1. Explore the data to look for the greatest correlations between the various bundles, promo strategies and profitability.
2. Explore the data to determine the most profitable SKUs and cities with the most valuable customers.
3. Create a markdown file for deployment.
4. Host the code on GitHub or GitLab.


## Research Questions
The project aims to answer the following research questions:
1. How did cost of goods sold (COGS) trends affect gross margins across months?
2. Are expense increases in 2020 justified by proportionate increases in EBIT?
3. What is the relationship between tax reductions and improvements in net income?
4. Which month had the highest EBIT-to-Revenue ratio and what operational factors contributed?
5. Which division(s) should receive more investment based on performance trends?

## About the Dataset
The datasets was fetched from Youtube (an online learning platform). It contains of 2 tables - namely Journal and Chart of Account (COA).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85f82a2e-1f3f-4df0-ba8b-06de3998f2c3)

[(Link to the dataset)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i778j9FUP08VgS25v64mK8oGUDGDGCxYe9vUziXigrg/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

The dataset 3223 rowa rows 12 columns with transactions and accounts information. The columns are described as follows:
**Journal**
* *Date*: Date a transaction is carried out
* *Division*: Regions (East, North, West, and South) where the company is operational
* *Description*: Transaction Detail
* *Dr*: Debit Column
* *Cr*: Credit Column
* *Amount*: Monetary value of transaction
**Chart of Account (COA)**
* *Account Code*: Unique ID for each account type
* *Account*: Account type
* *IS or BS*: Contains validation to identify entries categorized as either Income Statements (IS) or Balance Sheets (BS)
* *Category*: Type of Account e.g. Revenue, Finance Costs, etc.
* *Debit or Credit*: Agreed discount per SKU purchase
* *Debit or Credit*: Contains validations to identify a Debit (D) or Credit account (C)
* *Account Group*: Classifies various accounts into groups.

## Languages, Utilities, and Environments Used
* Microsoft Excel: Data Simulation
* Power Query: Data Automation: Cleaning, and Transformation
* Power BI: Data Analysis and Exploration [(link to the Power BI file)]()

## Importing the Datasets into Power BI
To import the dataset into Power BI, I proceeded as follows:  
* Launched the Microsoft Power BI app
* Created a blank report > Add data to your report > Import Data from Excel
* Clicked on Browse > selected the file from my computer > Open
* In the new window that appears, I clicked on the data to preview it then clicked on Transform Data 
* This launched into the Power Query editor > Next
* Validated column properties such as Data Type, Column Quality, Column Profile, and Column Distribution
* Then I proceeded to apply a couple of transformations and cleaning to the datasets as outlined in the next section.
The above steps successfully imported the dataset into my Power Query editor and ready for transformation.

## Data Automation: Cleaning and Transformation

### Unpivot Columns
* Unpivoted the Transaction types Credit (Cr), and Debit (Dr) columns to transform into rows instead of columns for useability 

```
#"Unpivoted Columns" = Table.UnpivotOtherColumns(#"Changed Type", {"Date", "Division", "Description", "Amount"}, "Attribute", "Value")
```

### Rename Columns
* Rename the newly created columns from the step above.

```
    #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Unpivoted Columns",{{"Attribute", "Type"}, {"Value", "Account"}}
```
## Add Custom Column 
* Add a custom column to negate all the debit entries and change data type

```
    #"Added Custom" = Table.AddColumn(#"Renamed Columns", "TB Amount", each if[Type] = "Dr" then [Amount]*-1 else [Amount])
    #"Changed Type1" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Added Custom",{{"TB Amount", type number}})
```
## Create a slicer table using the Division column
* Create a new table by referencing the journal table, then take out all other columns except the Division column, take out duplicates.

```
let
    Source = Journal,
    #"Removed Other Columns" = Table.SelectColumns(Source,{"Division"}),
    #"Removed Duplicates" = Table.Distinct(#"Removed Other Columns")
in
    #"Removed Duplicates"
```
## Create Calendar table
*  In the desktop view, create Calendar table, and mark as date table
```
Calendar = ADDCOLUMNS(
                    CALENDAR(MIN(Journal[Date]),max(Journal[Date])),
                    "Year", year([Date]),
                    "Month", month([Date]),
                    "Month Name", format([Date], "mmm")
                      )
```

## Data Analysis Approach


## Data Modelling
* Create a star schema data model by connecting all tables to the Journal table in a one-to-many relationship.

## Create Measures
* To visualize the 


## Data Analysis using SQL generated queries

1. **Top 5 Margins**
* SKUs with the top 5 gross margins: this will help in determining the most profitable SKUs. 
 
```
WITH margin_calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        ProductID,
        ProductName,
        (UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity AS Revenue,
        CostPrice * Quantity AS COGS
    FROM dbo.Pricing_Dataset
)
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    ROUND(AVG((Revenue - COGS) / Revenue), 2) AS Gross_Margin_Percent
FROM margin_calculation
WHERE ProductID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY Gross_Margin_Percent DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

2. **Promo Uplift**
* Comparing the performance in Revenue between the different promo types to the baseline sales to determine promo uplift. This will help in determing how each promo type affected revenue compared to sales without any promos applied.

```
with baseline_revenue as (
	select
		SUM((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity) as baseline_rev
	from 
		Pricing_Dataset
	where
		PromoApplied = 'FALSE'
		),
promo_revenue as (
	select 
		PromoType,
		sum((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity) as revenue_promo
	from 
		dbo.Pricing_Dataset
	where 
		PromoType in ('Discount','Volume Deal')
	group by
		PromoType
		)
select
	PromoType,
	round((revenue_promo-baseline_rev)/baseline_rev,2) as PromoUplift
from 
	baseline_revenue, promo_revenue;
```

3. **Average Order Volume (AOV)**
* Determining which promo type drove the highest average order volume. This will help in determining which SKUs is driving revenue in terms of return purchases i.e. frequency.
```
select 
	PromoType, 
	SUM(((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity))/
	COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS AOV
from
	dbo.Pricing_Dataset
where 
	PromoType in ('Discount','Volume Deal')
group by
	PromoType;
```

4. **Attach Rate**
* Determining which products have the highest attach rate - this will help in determining which products drive the most add-on i.e. products that are frequently purchased with other SKUs.

```
select 
	ProductID,
	ProductName,
	Avg(AttachRate) as attach_rate
from 
	dbo.Pricing_Dataset
where
	ProductID is not null
group by
	ProductID, ProductName
order by Avg(AttachRate) desc;
```

5. **Customer Lifetime Segmentation (CLV)**
* Determining the CLV by City - this will help in assesing which city is top performing in terms of the total worth of customer since acquisition

```
WITH CLV_calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        City,
        CustomerID, 
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(SignupDate), MAX(TransactionDate)) AS Customer_lifespan,
        COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS Purchase_Frequency,
        SUM((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS Avg_Revenue
    FROM 
        Pricing_Dataset
    GROUP BY
        City,
        CustomerID
),
CLV_per_customer AS (
    SELECT 
        City,
        (Avg_Revenue * Purchase_Frequency * Customer_lifespan) AS Customer_CLV,
		COUNT(distinct CustomerID) as total_customers
    FROM 
        CLV_calculation
	group by City, (Avg_Revenue * Purchase_Frequency * Customer_lifespan)
)
SELECT 
    City,
    SUM(Customer_CLV) / sum(total_customers) AS CLV_per_City
FROM 
    CLV_per_customer
GROUP BY 
    City
ORDER BY 
    CLV_per_City DESC;
```

6. **Bundle Performance**
* Determining which bundles are top performing in terms of margins and perception trade-off

```
select 
	ProductName as Bundle,
	round(sum(((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity)- CostPrice*Quantity)
		/ sum(((UnitPrice * (1 - DiscountPercent)) * Quantity)),4) as Gross_Margin_percent,
	count(distinct TransactionID) as number_of_orders,
	round(avg(AttachRate),2) as AttachRate
from 
	dbo.Pricing_Dataset
where 
	ProductCategory is null
group by
	ProductName
order by
	Gross_Margin_percent desc, 
	number_of_orders desc,
	AttachRate desc;
```
 
## Insights from the Data Analysis
1. **Top 5 Performing SKUs by Gross Margin**  
   * *Observation*: Rice (5Kg) and Cooking Oil generated the highest profit margin with 81% and 57% respectively. The remaining 3 SKUs - Soft Drink (29%), Milk (28%), and Pasta (28%) cluster closely with modest margins, significantly low compared to the top 2. 
   * *Insights*: The top two SKUs (Rice and Cooking Oil) significantly outperformed the others. This suggests highly profitable items and could be prioritized in sales strategies, promotions, or bundling. The low performance of the other 3 SKUs could indicate commodity pricing pressures or higher cost structures

2. **Promo Uplift - Discount Vs Volume Deals**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Volume Deal promotions show a positive uplift of +63%, while discount promotion show a negative uplift of -41%.
   * *Insights*: The high promo uplift value for volume deals indicate they are effective at increasing sales or purchase quantities, and suggests that customers are responding well to offers that reward bulk buying. On the other hand, the extremely low value of discount deals indicate they may be hurting performance â€” possibly by eroding perceived value or not driving sufficient volume to compensate for the price drop.

3. **Which Promo resulted in higher AOV?**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Volume Deals generate a significantly higher AOV of â‚¦65,186, compared to just â‚¦25,937 for Discount promotions.
     * This means that customers who engage with Volume Deal promos spend ~151% more per order than those responding to Discount promos.
   * *Insights*: 
        * Volume-based incentives are not only driving higher sales (as seen in the promo uplift data) but also contributing to larger basket sizes.
        * Discounts, while common, are leading to lower average revenue per order, which may hurt profitability â€” especially if the uplift is also negative.

4. **Which Products Drive the Most Add-Ons?**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Top 3 Products with highest attach rate - Beer (41.4%), Pasta (41.1%), Noodles (40.7%).
     * Mid Performers: Rice (40.5%), Seasoning (40.3%), Tomato Paste (40.1%).
     * Low Performers: Eggs (39.7%), Milk (39.4%), Cooking Oil (39.2%), Soft Drink (38.1%)
   * *Insights*: The top 3 performers have the highest attach rates, meaning they are most effective at driving add-on purchases. The mid performing products also encourage add-on purchases but not as strongly as the top 3.

5. **Which Cities have the highest Customer Lifetime Value?**  
   * *Observation*: Customers in Abuja are the most valuable customers with â‚¦3.33 million in CLV. Port Harcourt and Lagos follow closely with â‚¦3.05 million and â‚¦2.98 million respectively, while Ibadan lags closely behind at â‚¦2.83 million â€” still substantial, but lower than the others.
    * *Insights*: 
        * The high CLV in Abuja suggests This suggests higher spending, stronger loyalty, or longer customer relationships.
        * Port Harcourt and Lagos though behind Abuja are still key markets with high potential for revenue growth.
        * The lower CLV in Ibadan may indicate room to improve retention or increase purchase frequency/value.
6. **Which Bundles Give the Best Margin vs Perception Tradeoff?**  
   * *Observation*:  
     * **Party Pack**: Highest attach rate (41%), strong gross margin (11.4%), high number of orders (63)  
     * **Naija Jollof Combo**: Strong attach rate (40%), good margin (11.39%), 58 orders  
     * **Breakfast Starter**: Strong attach rate (40%), good margin (11.27%), 58 orders  
     * **Ready for Lunch**: Highest number of orders (70), strong attach rate (39%), slightly lower margin (11.32%)  
     * **Night with the Clique**: Slightly lower attach rate (37%), lowest number of orders (51), still profitable margin (11.38%)  
   * *Insights*:  
     * Party Pack stands out as the most balanced performer, combining high attach rate, margin, and order volume â€” making it a flagship bundle for driving profits and perception.  
     * Naija Jollof Combo and Breakfast Starter also deliver excellent tradeoffs, with consistent performance across all key metrics.  
     * Ready for Lunch shows strong demand (highest orders), making it a volume-driven performer despite a slightly lower margin.  
     * Night with the Clique, while profitable, may need better positioning or promotional support due to lower orders and attach rate.


## Recommendations from the Data Analysis
1. **Prioritize High Attach-Rate Products in Bundle Design and Promotions**
        * Products like Beer (0.414), Pasta (0.411), and Noodles (0.407) consistently trigger additional purchases. These should anchor future bundle configurations and upselling strategies. For instance, combining Beer with complementary snacks or cooking items may drive both unit economics and perceived value, especially if margin tolerances allow for a small incentive.
2. **Optimize Bundle Pricing Around Perceived Value Leaders**    
        * Bundles such as Party Pack and Naija Jollof Combo demonstrate strong attach rates (â‰¥0.40) while maintaining margins above 11%. This signals a positive value perception among customers. Pricing should aim to preserve this perception without compressing margins â€” small anchor price adjustments (e.g., Â±â‚¦50â€“â‚¦100) can be tested A/B-style to find the optimal price elasticity point.  
3. **Deprioritize or Repackage Low-Perception, Low-Volume Bundles**  
        * Night with the Cliq underperforms on both attach rate (0.37) and order volume (51), despite having a comparable margin to better-performing bundles. This suggests a disconnect between value offered and customer expectations. Consider repackaging it with a more desirable lead product or retiring it in favor of bundles that have shown stronger traction.
4.	**Develop City-Specific Bundling Strategies Based on CLV**  
        * Abuja and Port Harcourt lead in customer lifetime value (â‚¦3.33M and â‚¦3.05M respectively). For these cities, prioritize higher-margin bundles and explore personalized, premium-tier offerings. In contrast, Ibadan, with a lower CLV (~â‚¦2.83M), may respond better to value-driven bundles with leaner margins but higher frequency.
5.	**Reinforce Anchor Products with Strategic Discounts**  
        * High attach rate products like Beer and Pasta can be used as loss leaders or marginally discounted items within a bundle to amplify volume. The goal is to attract customers into higher-margin ecosystems (e.g., full meal kits), where perceived value is high but the cost of goods is strategically controlled through careful product selection.
6.	**Double Down on Volume-Based Promotions**  
        * Volume deals not only boost promo uplift (+63%) but also generate significantly higher AOV (â‚¦65,186 vs â‚¦25,937 for discounts). Shift promotional strategy away from blanket discounts toward Buy More, Save More type offers. This maximizes both basket size and total revenue while maintaining price integrity.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights clear levers for driving revenue and profitability: 
focus on volume-based promotions, bundle high-margin and high-attach products, and tailor strategies by city CLV. Shifting away from underperforming discounts and SKUs will sharpen commercial efficiency, while scaling high-performing bundles can further unlock growth.

## Glossary of Terms
1.  **Attach Rate**
        * Is the percentage of primary product sales that are accompanied by the purchase of a secondary product or service. It essentially measures the success of upselling or cross-selling related products.
2.  **Average Order Value (AOV)**
        * Is a key business performance indicator (KPI) that measures the average amount of money customers spend per transaction. It's calculated by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders within a specific time period.
3. **Bundles**    
        * A pricing strategy that involves combining multiple products or services into a single package sold at a discounted price or with added value compared to buying them separately.
4. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
        * Is a metric that predicts the total net profit a business expects to generate from a customer throughout their entire relationship with the company. It's a forward-thinking approach that helps businesses understand the long-term value of acquiring and retaining customers.
5. **Discounts**  
        * Is a reduction in the regular or list price of a product or service. It's a strategy used by businesses to make their offerings more attractive to customers, often to increase sales or clear out old inventory.
6.  **Gross Margin(%)**
        * Is a key measure of profitability that represents the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS), essentially showing how much profit a company makes from its core operations.
7.	**Revenue**  
        * Is the total amount of money brought in by a company's operations, measured over a set amount of time. A business's revenue is its gross income before subtracting any expenses.
8.  **Upsell**
        * Is a sales technique where a seller suggests a more expensive or upgraded version of a product or service to a customer, aiming to increase the total value of the sale.
